### Course Structure

---

Class time will be spent as a combination of lecture, review, and in class exercises. Homework will consist of online tutorials as well as weekly projects that build on each week’s topics of discussion.

It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a github repo for their assignments.

#### Readings

There is no required textbook for this course, however students will be required to complete various readings and tutorials between classes.

#### Phone, Laptop, and other Electronics Use

Laptops and mobile devices are useful tools for learning and interaction within this class. However, they can create distractions that take away from a student’s ability to actively participate. The structure of the class is dependent on each student’s engagement. So please be mindful of the ways in which these devices can be a distraction.

We should be courteous to one another and when we have outside guests, during discussion or student presentations laptops use should be curtailed.

## Grading

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

**Regular Assignments 25%**

We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class.

**Mid-Term Project 15%**

The midterm assignment will be a project that demonstrates a working knowledge of HTML and CSS elements.

**Final Project 25%**

Class will culminate with final projects. It is expected that these will be both technology and content driven. The final project will be built over the course of several weeks.

**Documentation 10%**

IDM coursework documentation using your github repo for this class. Please use Markdown files.

**Participation and Attendance 25%**

Attendance is _mandatory_. Please inform me via email if you are going to miss a class. Showing up late for class or an excessive number of absences will adversely affect your grade. This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. This (along with attendance) is 25% of your overall grade.

**PLEASE NOTE: 2 unexcused absences will result in your grade dropping 5%**

This class is taught via in person instruction. If a class is to be taught via Zoom, this will be communicated well ahead of time. Zoom attendance is not an option during in person instruction. If you are sick, traveling for a conference, job interview, or family emergency, please email me ahead of time and request absence accomodations through the proper channels to ensure your absence is excused. If you do not follow this protocol, absences will be marked as unexcused.

**PLEASE NOTE: 2 excessive latenesses (15 minutes or more) will result in an unexcused absence**

> If you miss a class for any reason, it is your responsibility to reach out to me and catch yourself up via class notes and in class examples posted in this repository. After reviewing all materials, if you still have questions, please book office hours.
